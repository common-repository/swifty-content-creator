No more switching between edit mode and preview. This page builder let's you see what your visitors will see, while you're editing. 

== Description ==

####Create beautiful content fast and easy.

Using the WordPress editor to create beautiful pages *(that go beyond plain text and an image or two)* is quite a challenge. Especially if you're not a developer. So it’s no surprise that dozens of front-end editors and page builders have launched in the past few years. They all try to make things easier. 

However, most of them assume you have a certain level of WordPress knowledge. And that you understand some WordPress vocabulary. Most of them work with popups and overlays in which you then have to put the content. Then save. And then see what it actually looks like. Some advanced users may even like it that way, but

Swifty Content Creator is different.    
*Way different.*

Swifty Content Creator is built - from the ground up - for people who haven’t even heard of WordPress. It’s **built for the end-user**. 

For plumbers and painters.   
For store-owners and consultants.   
For the secretary of a law firm, that is asked to manage the website on the side.   
For the mom of the kid that plays soccer at the local soccer club who volunteered to take on the club’s website.   

So, yeah, this page builder plugin is not for everyone. If you’re a WordPress developer, you may not like it for yourself. But your customers will love it. And if you’re a website owner looking for an easy way to create beautiful content for your pages, then **read on my friend! Cause you’re gonna love this ;-)**

####Swifty Content Creator - Beautiful Content Made Easy   

You can create all kinds of content for the pages and blog posts of your website. Not just text and images, but also buttons, a contact form, video’s and more. Swifty Content Creator has a big bottom bar in which you can do everything. So *you won’t have any popup’s blocking your view* while you’re editing. 

Actually…

**You see what your visitors will see, while you are editing!**

You can use a grid, with rows and columns if you like. Most front-end editors work with adding rows and filling those rows with content in columns. And although you can totally do that with Swifty, you don’t have to. **You don’t *have* to use a grid.** You can also simply write your content and add images and other components (video, maps, forms, etcetera) and re-arrange them with the **text wrapping beautifully around them.**

It’s simple, elegant and easy to use.

**But if you *do* want to work with a grid...**

Then use the grid by inserting a row and dividing it into columns. That way you can **create all kinds of page layout blocks that you can re-use** elsewhere on the site if you like :-) Or you can **pick one of the cleverly designed content-templates**; combinations of content blocks that are frequently used, such as pricing tables, category comparisons, meet the team layouts and more.   
Way more!

Most front-end editors and visual page builders and composers show pop-up panels that get in the way. Swifty Content Creator tries to avoid that and **provides you with a true what-you-see-is-what-your-site-visitors-will-get experience.**

####Here’s why you should definitely give Swifty Content Creator a try:  

**You will see what your visitors will see, while you are creating the page**   
You no longer have to switch between edit and preview mode. You see the page as the visitors of your site will see it. That way you can quickly and easily see where your content should go and how it fits in the page.

**All content is responsive**    
So the pages will do very well in Google Page Speed Insights (if your theme is up to par)

**Text wrapping around elements**   
If text is the hero on your page, let it wrap beautifully around elements such as a video, a quote, or even a contactform, much in the same way text wraps around images.

**Rows with columns**   
Easily insert a row with columns in different proportions and fill those columns with content. If you like what you have created you can save it as a preset for future use on that site.

**Content templates**   
Smart combinations of columns and content that our designers have prepared for you so you can build pages fast. Includes:   
 - Meet the team   
 - Pricing table   
 - Call to action   
 - Icons & text   
 - Images & text   
 - Buttons & text   
 - Testimonial   
 - etc.   

**Full page layouts**   
Time saving combinations of presets for your home page, contact page, landing page, meet-the-team page and way more.

**Break out bars**   
Stunning full width (fully responsive) content area’s that you can fill with all kinds of content and backgrounds. Particulary helpfull if you want to tell a story or explain a product or service on a single page. Break out bars create chapters or segments each addressing a different aspect of your story or explanation, providing a well structured overview.

**It will save you time**   
No longer go back and forth between editor en preview because you work in the front-end

**Auto-optimizes your images**   
And does it even better than default WordPress - upload any image and let Swifty handle the rest

**Easily add components**   
Such as a contactform, button, video, icon, quote and lots more.

**Theme independant**   
Works well with most themes

**Write text, not code**   
Shortcodes are rendered so you can actually see what your page will look like.

**Developer friendly**   
Build pages faster while also having the freedom to add special stuff in the back-end

**Two way compatible with WordPress editor**   
You can do fancy stuff in the back-end and editing in the front-end will still work just fine

**Works for multi sites**   
Install once and use on all your multi sites

**Distraction free**   
The User Interface is neutral (maybe even boring) on purpose, so that it doesn’t distract you from beautifying your own website

**Up-to-date**   
Works with the latest version of WordPress, often within a week after a new release.

**Compatible**   
Works well with many other plugins, such as WooCommerce and Ninja Forms

*Right now this plugin works reliably with Chrome, Firefox and Safari (version 9 or higher). The sites that are created with this plugin look great in any browser (if your theme is up to standards).*

**Why not give it a try?**   
It’s free :-)

####What would life be like…   

... if you could easily create beautiful content on the pages of your WordPress site, without having to switch back and forth between editor and preview-mode? Imagine not having to work in between shortcodes, but in the fully rendered front-end.

... if you could just **upload an image and let Swifty take care of the rest**, always automatically picking the right image to show the site’s visitors. No more hassle in preparing images and making sure you pick the right one each time.
